Given a program compile it and print its output to STDOUT.

The given language has 8 types of statements:

    ECHO 1 => prints the given number to STDOUT. Eg: ECHO 1 prints 1 to STDOUT
    EXIT => exits the program
    SET a 0 => assign variable a value 0, i.e. equivalent to a = 0
    ADD 1 2 b => add 1(first) and 2(second) and assign its value to b(third), equivalent to b = 1 + 2. Value 3 will be assigned to variable b
    GOTO and LABEL

LABEL 12
<statement>
<statement>
<statement>
GOTO 12

The GOTO statement jumps to corresponding LABEL (defined by argument). The LABEL can occur either before or after GOTO statement.

    IF and END

IF a 10
<statement>
<statement>
<statement>
END

If a(first argument) is equal to 10(second argument) then only statements between IF and END will be executed otherwise they will bot be executed.

    CONTINUE

IF a 10
<statement>
<statement>
CONTINUE
<statement>
END

CONTINUE is used inside IF END block. CONTINUE jumps to the corresponding IF statement of the block.
Note:

    All arguments are whole numbers only.
    Variables names can only consist alphabetic[a-z] characters.
    All variables are intially 0. You don't need to SET a variable before using it.
